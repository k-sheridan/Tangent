Concepts
========

This section explains the core concepts in Tangent: how to define variables
that live on manifolds, how to create error terms that constrain those
variables, and how to use automatic differentiation to avoid hand-deriving
Jacobians. Code examples are shown in both C++ and Python where applicable.
